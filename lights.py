'''
Dynalite components communicate using DyNet.
The physical layer consists of a modified RS-485 TIA/EIA-485-A
serial bus running along CAT5 cable, blue and blue/white
carry the hot and cold signal respectively,
orange and orange/white carry +12 V DC,
green and green/white carry 0 V,
Brown and Brown/white are unused.
End of line termination is required [2]

DyNet 1 is the most commonly used protocol over the bus,
being messages of 8 bytes of data,
the 8th byte being a checksum.
Data is send at speed of 9600 baud, 8 bits, no parity, 1 stopbit (8N1).
Commonly there are two types of message sent via DyNet 1: logical and physical.
Logical messages talk to Areas and Channels,
and physical messages talk directly to the devices.
These 2 are typically called 1C and 5C messages,
on account of the first byte of their message.

A 1C message consist of:
[1C] [Area] [Data 1] [OpCode] [Data 2] [Data 3] [Join] [Checksum]

Area is the Logical Area the message is to control.

OpCode defines the Action to be taken on the Area.

Join is a bitswitch which can be used to filter out selected channels.

An OpCode of 00 to 03 means the action is to send the
given area into preset 1 to 4 plus 8 times the value
of Data 3 over the time specified by Data 1 and Data 2.

An OpCode of 0A to 0D means the action is to send
the given area into preset 5 to 8 plus 8 times
the value of Data 3 over the time specified by Data 1 and Data 2.

That gives a possibility of 8 Ã— 255 presets.
A usual job uses 4 to 8,
and generally preset 4 is reserved to 'Off' or 'all to 0%'.
